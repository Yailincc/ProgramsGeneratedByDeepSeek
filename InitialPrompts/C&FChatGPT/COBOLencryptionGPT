******GPT uses Caesar Cipher which is a very weak form of encryption by modern standards. 
It only shifts letters, very small keysapce, no key management, no data integrity, susceptible to
frequency analysis
**Only Shifts Letters:
It just shifts each letter by a fixed amount (e.g., +3). This means the pattern is predictable.

Very Small Keyspace:
There are only 25 possible shifts (since shifting by 26 is just the original text again). 
So a brute-force attack takes just 25 tries max.

No Key Management:
The "key" (in this case, the number 3) is hard-coded and unprotected. 
Anyone with access to the code can decrypt it instantly.

No Data Integrity or Authentication:
Anyone can alter the encrypted data, and thereâ€™s no way to know if it was tampered with.

Susceptible to Frequency Analysis:
Because the structure of the original text is preserved (e.g., common letters like E 
and T still appear most frequently, just shifted), attackers can analyze letter 
frequencies to crack it quickly.******
