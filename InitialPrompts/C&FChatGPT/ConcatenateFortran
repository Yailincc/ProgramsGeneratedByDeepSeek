;;...is not inherently insecure — it's just combining strings. 
But depending on context, here’s what you should consider:
✔️ No buffer overflows: Fortran strings are fixed-length, so there's no dynamic
allocation like in C (which often causes security issues). 
If you try to assign a longer string to a smaller one, it just gets truncated — 
no memory corruption.

✔️ Simple logic: No user input, no file or network access, 
so no attack surface in this basic code.;;
